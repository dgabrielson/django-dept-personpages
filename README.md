# django-dept-personpages

This app provides personal pages for people; as well as the ability to edit
those pages.

It does not require the directoy app (but does require the people app), both
in `django-dept-directory`, however if the directory is being used it will be
autodetected and taken advantage of (for office info and research tags).
